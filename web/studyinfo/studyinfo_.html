	<h2>PURPOSE OF STUDY</h2>
	The purpose of this research study is to investigate people’s understanding of expertise within the field of software engineering (SE). We wish to gain an understanding of SE expertise based on the perception of people who are associated with the field. The initial outline of the topics will act as a springboard for more detailed questions which will arise from participant’s responses.

	<h2>SUBJECTS</h2>
	<h3 class="i">Inclusion Requirements</h3>
	You are eligible to participate in this study if you are at least 18 years old or older and have some knowledge of software engineering activities, work products and processes. 
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="left">
	<h3 class="i">Exclusion Requirements</h3>
	You are not eligible to participate in this study if you have no knowledge of software engineering or your age is less than 18 years old.
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="left">
	<h3 class="i">Number of Participants and Time Commitment</h3>
	This study will include approximately 60 subjects and will involve approximately three hours of your time.
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="left">
	<h2>PROCEDURES</h2>
	The following procedures will occur:  In this study, you will be surveyed about your experience as a software engineer. This survey may be a written questionnaire or a verbal interview.  The questionnaire may be administered on paper or over the Internet on a web site. The interview may be in person or over the telephone or by email.  You will also be asked to answer questions that will assist researchers in evaluating their expertise. Questions will all pertain to the principal areas in Software Engineering (SE), namely: software development (requirements, design, coding) and social (people, groups, organization). You may be asked for examples of your work, including hard copy documents and computer files. The hard copy documents may include notes and reports. Computer files may include computer source code, design diagrams, project plans, testing plans, logs from tools, and requirements and specification documents.
