	<li>You are being asked to participate in a research study about how software engineering is performed in practice. Data on what software developers actually do is needed to help researchers focus on the right problems and guide the creation of new software tools and methods.</li>
<br>
	<li>The research procedures involve observing you and your team as you are doing your daily work over the next few weeks. This is a longitudinal study. The observation will last for approximately 3 months, with the researchers visiting approximately 3 times per week. We will be taking written notes of our observations. We will be asking you questions about your work. You may be asked for a formal audio-taped interview lasting approximately 45-60 minutes at a location convenient for you. </li>
<br>
	<li>We will also be asking for examples of work, including hard copy documents and computer files. The artifacts may include user stories and reports. Computer files may include computer source code, design diagrams, project plans, testing plans, logs from tools, and requirements and specification documents.</li>
<br>
	<li>The only foreseeable discomfort associated with the study is the invasion of your privacy. There are no direct benefits from participation in the study. However, this study may help researchers better understand how software engineers in practice differ from the expectations found in theory and books. These insights will lead to the creation of better software tools and methods that will help developers create software that is more reliable in less time and with greater ease.</li>
<br>
	<li>Participation in this study is voluntary. There is no cost to you for participating. You may refuse to participate or discontinue your involvement at any time without penalty. You may choose to skip a question or a study procedure. Your decision to participate in this research will have no affect on your current or future employment relationship with Mirth Corporation.</li>
<br>
	<li>You will not be paid for your participation in this research.</li>
<br>
	<li>All research data collected will be stored securely and confidentially in locked filing cabinet in a secure office. Audio tapes and photographs are for data collection purposes only and will not be published without your permission. Your name will not be published to protect your privacy. We might take photographs of team meetings, the workspace, and your activities. Photographs will be taken only with your approval. </li>
<br>
	<li>The research team and authorized UCI personnel may have access to your study records to protect your safety and welfare. Any information derived from this research project that personally identifies you will not be voluntarily released or disclosed by these entities without your separate consent, except as specifically required by law.</li>
<br>
	<li>If you have any comments, concerns, or questions regarding the conduct of this research please contact the researchers listed at the top of this form.</li>
<br>
	<li>If you are unable to reach the researchers listed at the top of the form and have general questions, or you have concerns or complaints about the research, or questions about your rights as a research subject, please contact UCIâ€™s Office of Research by phone, (949) 824-6662, by e-mail at IRB@rgs.uci.edu or at 5171 California Avenue, Suite 150, Irvine, CA  92697-7600.</li>
